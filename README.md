# World_Weather_Analysis
## Module 6
The purpose of the World Weather Analysis project was to use APIs to pull weather data from all over the world. Using this data, we were able to make an app to help decide where to go based on the temperature you want to enjoy. Once a destination was selected, we were able to create a mapped, looping route of four cities in the country of choice. This project can make it easier to plan trips for people who want to enjoy their vacations stress- and hassle-free.
